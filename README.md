# SecureDataTransmission

This is a Python application demonstrating secure data handling using hashing, encryption, and digital signatures. This site utlizies the key cybersecurity principles including the CIA triad, entropy in cryptography, and secure authentication.

Accepts structured user input (e.g., name, address, contact info)
Hashes input using SHA-256 to ensure integrity
Encrypts input using AES symmetric encryption
Decrypts and verifies integrity via hash comparison
Signs and verifies data using RSA digital signatures
Role-based access control (admin/user)
